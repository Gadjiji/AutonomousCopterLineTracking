# AutonomousCopterLineTracking
Code used for the MAAXX 2018 competition

Based on two OpenMakerDrone example, the simple line detection and GUIDED_NOGPS, it was possible to realize
a code that allow an hexacopter to track and follow a line on the floor. The final code was written by 
Gabriel Damian for the A3T student drone team of the University of Twente, Netherlands in preperation
to the MAAXX 2018 competition in Bristol, UK.

The code is still in its research phase and is dangerous to be implemented.
